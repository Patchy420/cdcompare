# CD12Key – Static MVP

This is a very simple static website for comparing game key prices.

Files:

- `index.html` – main page
- `style.css` – basic dark styling
- `script.js` – loads and displays data
- `games.json` – all games and offers (you can edit this file in GitHub to add more games)

To deploy:

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload these four files to the root of the repo.
3. Connect the repo to Vercel and deploy as a static site.

To add games or update prices:

- Open `games.json` in GitHub, click **Edit**, change the data and commit.
- The live site will update automatically after redeploy.
